Detailed descriptions are as follows: Supplementary table 1 All the whole-rock raw data used to construct the magma fertility discrimination model in this paper; Supplementary table 2 All the whole-rock data (after preprocessing) used to construct the magma fertility discrimination model in this paper; Supplementary table S3 The whole-rock data used in this paper to determine the magma fertility of the Tibetan Plateau. All the data are from the Tibetan Magmatism Database (Chapman and Kapp 2017); Supplementary table 4 The zircon ages of the Tibetan Plateau are used in this paper. All from GEOROC and magmatism dataset (Chapman and Kapp, 2017); Supplementary table 5 Porphyry system deposit information collected in this paper; Supplementary table S6 All hyperparameters in the models and the optimal values; Supplementary table S7 Feature importance based on 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the Random Forest model for the collision-related dataset; Supplementary table S8 Feature importance based on 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the Random Forest model for the subduction-related dataset; Supplementary table S9 Feature importance based on 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the Random Forest model for the total whole-rock dataset; Supplementary table S10 SHAP value based on 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the XGboost model for the collision-related dataset; Supplementary table S11 SHAP value based on 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the XGboost model for the subduction-related dataset; Supplementary table S12 SHAP value based on 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the XGboost model for the total whole-rock dataset; Supplementary table S13 Magma fertility discrimination results of the three models on the new Tibetan Plateau whole-rock dataset (Table S3).
